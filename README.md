# Ball-Bouncer
<h2> first version </h2>
<p>First initial version when trying to flex on my friend with the knowledge of pygame and python. Could only bounce on walls and the ball itself was very simplistic. Not optimised yet.</p>

<h2> second version </h2>
<p>Now with explosions and pretty okay optimizations where 100 balls at once was possible.</p>

<h2> third version </h2>
<p>Now with collisions between balls and explosion when they do so. Sometimes raises a error when trying to remove one of the balls colliding, but not quite sure what casues this. Uses a try and finally to handle this which isnt the best.</p>
